# Install Laravel

If you have cloned this project from Github, skip to "Installing dependencies"

## Laravel installer
Install the installer
```Shell
composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

Make sure to place the ~/.composer/vendor/bin directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS)
in your PATH so the laravel executable can be located by your system.

Install Laravel with the installer
```Shell
$ laravel new myproject
```

You can also use Composer to install Laravel:

## Install Laravel with Composer
Get Laravel with Composer
```Shell
$ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject
```

## Installing dependencies
Enter your `myproject` directory and install dependencies
```Shell
$ composer install
$ npm install
```

## Run Laravel
```Shell
$ php artisan serve
```

Or use php built-in server to serve from the public directory
```Shell
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
