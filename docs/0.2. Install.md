# Install Laravel

## Laravel installer
Install the installer
```Shell
composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

Install Laravel 
```Shell
$ laravel new myproject
```

However, sometimes this doesn't work, as the server is a bit flaky. Just use Composer instead then:


## Composer
Get Laravel with Composer
```Shell
$ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel myproject
```

## Dependencies
Enter your `myproject` directory and install npm dependencies
```Shell
$ npm install
```

## Run Laravel
```Shell
$ php artisan serve
```

Or use php built-in server to serve from the public directory
```Shell
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```
